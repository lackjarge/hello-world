# hello-world

Hi,

I'm a old-school techie (read stuck in the 80s) trying to learn new stuff - never really been a programmer and thought it was time to at least try to get the simple stuff right.

I enjoy 2-Tone, Northern Soul, Marvel Champions, comics generally and lots of other geek stuff.

Oh - and I take pictures - but not in a phone-selfie sort of way - more in a camera-that-can't-make-phone-calls sort of way.

Thanks for reading - you're an OK human.

Cheers,

Frank L.
